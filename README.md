Glitchbus Prototyping Board
===========================

This project is a prototyping board for Glitchbus, which is used on several of our SBC projects. It provides a pad-per-hole board with dedicated areas for the Glitchbus. All signal pins are labeled on front and back. It is compatible with both stacking and backplane configurations, and will accomodate wire wrapping.

Aside from being a useful prototyping board, this project can be used as the starting point for a custom Glitchbus PCBs.
